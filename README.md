## Customization Guide

### 1. **Replace Placeholder Content**

#### Artist Information
- Update the artist name in the navigation and throughout the site
- Replace the artist bio in the About section
- Update contact information (email, phone, location)
- Add your actual social media links

#### Artwork
- Replace placeholder artwork with your actual pieces
- Update artwork titles, descriptions, prices, and dimensions
- Add high-quality images of your artwork

### 2. **Adding Real Images**

Replace the placeholder artwork divs with actual images:

```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<div class="artwork-placeholder">
    <i class="fas fa-palette"></i>
</div>

<!-- With this -->
<img src="path/to/your/artwork.jpg" alt="Artwork Title" class="artwork-image">
```

### 3. **Customizing Colors**

The main color scheme uses CSS custom properties. Update these in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
    --text-color: #333;
    --background-color: #fafafa;
}
```

### 4. **Contact Form Integration**

The contact form currently shows a success message. To make it functional:

1. Set up a backend service (Node.js, PHP, etc.)
2. Update the form submission handler in `script.js`
3. Replace the simulated submission with actual API calls

### 5. **Payment Integration**

For selling artwork, integrate with:
- Stripe for credit card payments
- PayPal for alternative payment methods
- Square for in-person transactions
